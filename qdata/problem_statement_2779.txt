E. Distinctive Roots in a Treetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Each vertex $$$i$$$ has a value $$$a_i$$$ associated with it.Let us root the tree at some vertex $$$v$$$. The vertex $$$v$$$ is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at $$$v$$$ and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).The following $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u$$$, $$$v \le n$$$), denoting an edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinctive roots in the tree.ExamplesInput
