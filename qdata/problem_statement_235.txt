B. Not Quite Latin Squaretime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA Latin square is a $$$3 \times 3$$$ grid made up of the letters $$$\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\texttt{B}$$$, and $$$\texttt{C}$$$ such that:   in each row, the letters $$$\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\texttt{B}$$$, and $$$\texttt{C}$$$ each appear once, and  in each column, the letters $$$\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\texttt{B}$$$, and $$$\texttt{C}$$$ each appear once.  For example, one possible Latin square is shown below. $$$$$$\begin{bmatrix} \texttt{A} & \texttt{B} & \texttt{C} \\ \texttt{C} & \texttt{A} & \texttt{B} \\ \texttt{B} & \texttt{C} & \texttt{A} \\ \end{bmatrix}$$$$$$You are given a Latin square, but one of the letters was replaced with a question mark $$$\texttt{?}$$$. Find the letter that was replaced.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 108$$$) — the number of testcases.Each test case contains three lines, each consisting of three characters, representing the Latin square. Each character is one of $$$\texttt{A}$$$, $$$\texttt{B}$$$, $$$\texttt{C}$$$, or $$$\texttt{?}$$$.Each test case is a Latin square with exactly one of the letters replaced with a question mark $$$\texttt{?}$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the letter that was replaced.ExampleInput
