The rows are numbered top to bottom, the columns are numbered left to right.Each cell of the matrix can be either free or locked.Let's call a path in the matrix a staircase if it:   starts and ends in the free cell;  visits only free cells;  has one of the two following structures:   the second cell is $$$1$$$ to the right from the first one, the third cell is $$$1$$$ to the bottom from the second one, the fourth cell is $$$1$$$ to the right from the third one, and so on;  the second cell is $$$1$$$ to the bottom from the first one, the third cell is $$$1$$$ to the right from the second one, the fourth cell is $$$1$$$ to the bottom from the third one, and so on.  In particular, a path, consisting of a single cell, is considered to be a staircase.Here are some examples of staircases:  Initially all the cells of the matrix are free.You have to process $$$q$$$ queries, each of them flips the state of a single cell. So, if a cell is currently free, it makes it locked, and if a cell is currently locked, it makes it free.Print the number of different staircases after each query. Two staircases are considered different if there exists such a cell that appears in one path and doesn't appear in the other path.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 1000$$$; $$$1 \le q \le 10^4$$$) — the sizes of the matrix and the number of queries.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le n$$$; $$$1 \le y \le m$$$) — the description of each query.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — the $$$i$$$-th value should be equal to the number of different staircases after $$$i$$$ queries. Two staircases are considered different if there exists such a cell that appears in one path and doesn't appear in the other path.ExamplesInput
