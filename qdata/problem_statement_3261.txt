He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least $$$k$$$ subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string $$$s$$$ is a subset of ten characters of $$$s$$$ that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times: codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome.Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least $$$k$$$ codeforces subsequences.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq 10^{16})$$$.OutputPrint a shortest string of lowercase English letters that contains at least $$$k$$$ codeforces subsequences. If there are several such strings, print any of them.ExamplesInput
