D. Min Cost Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define the cost of a string $$$s$$$ as the number of index pairs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j < |s|$$$) such that $$$s_i = s_j$$$ and $$$s_{i+1} = s_{j+1}$$$.You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Among all strings with length $$$n$$$ that contain only the first $$$k$$$ characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possible cost. If there are multiple such strings with minimum cost â€” find any of them.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5; 1 \le k \le 26$$$).OutputPrint the string $$$s$$$ such that it consists of $$$n$$$ characters, each its character is one of the $$$k$$$ first Latin letters, and it has the minimum possible cost among all these strings. If there are multiple such strings â€” print any of them.ExamplesInput
