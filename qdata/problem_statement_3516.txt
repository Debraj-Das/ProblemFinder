D. Ehab the Xorcisttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven 2 integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, find the shortest array such that bitwise-xor of its elements is $$$u$$$, and the sum of its elements is $$$v$$$.InputThe only line contains 2 integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(0 \le u,v \le 10^{18})$$$.OutputIf there's no array that satisfies the condition, print "-1". Otherwise:The first line should contain one integer, $$$n$$$, representing the length of the desired array. The next line should contain $$$n$$$ positive integers, the array itself. If there are multiple possible answers, print any.ExamplesInput
