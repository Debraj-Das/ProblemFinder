F. Interacdive Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis problem is interactive.We decided to play a game with you and guess the number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x < n$$$), where you know the number $$$n$$$.You can make queries like this: + c: this command assigns $$$x = x + c$$$ ($$$1 \le c < n$$$) and then returns you the value $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{n}\rfloor$$$ ($$$x$$$ divide by $$$n$$$ and round down).You win if you guess the current number with no more than $$$10$$$ queries.InteractionThe interaction begins by reading an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 < n \le 1000$$$), which is written in the input data on its own line.Then you can make no more than $$$10$$$ queries. To make a query, print on a separate line:  + c: this command will assign $$$x = x + c$$$ ($$$1 \le c < n$$$) and then print $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{n}\rfloor$$$ (divide $$$x$$$ by $$$n$$$ and round down) on a separate line.  Print the answer, like the queries, on a separate line. The answer doesn't count in number of queries. To output it, use the following format:  ! x: the current value of $$$x$$$. After that, your program should exit.You have to use a flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the function fflush(stdout), in Java — System.out.flush(), in Pascal — flush(output) and in Python — sys.stdout.flush().Note that the interactor is not responsive.To make a hack, use the following format: a single line must contain two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$n$$$, separated by a space.ExamplesInput

! 20NoteIn the first sample initially $$$x = 2$$$. After the first query $$$x = 3$$$, $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{n}\rfloor = 1$$$.In the second sample also initially $$$x = 2$$$. After the first query $$$x = 3$$$, $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{n}\rfloor = 0$$$. After the second query $$$x = 4$$$, $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{n}\rfloor = 0$$$. After the third query $$$x=5$$$, $$$\lfloor\frac{x}{n}\rfloor = 1$$$.
