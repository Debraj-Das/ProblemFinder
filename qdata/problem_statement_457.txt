F. Jellyfish and OEIStime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJellyfish always uses OEIS to solve math problems, but now she finds a problem that cannot be solved by OEIS:Count the number of permutations $$$p$$$ of $$$[1, 2, \dots, n]$$$ such that for all $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$l \leq r \leq m_l$$$, the subarray $$$[p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r]$$$ is not a permutation of $$$[l, l+1, \dots, r]$$$.Since the answer may be large, you only need to find the answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200$$$) — the length of the permutation.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq m_i \leq n$$$).OutputOutput the number of different permutations that satisfy the conditions, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExamplesInput
