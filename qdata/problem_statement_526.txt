G. Swapstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$). You can perform the following operation several (possibly, zero) times:  pick an arbitrary $$$i$$$ and perform swap$$$(a_i, a_{a_i})$$$. How many distinct arrays is it possible to attain? Output the answer modulo $$$(10^9 + 7)$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le n$$$).OutputOutput the number of attainable arrays modulo $$$(10^9 + 7)$$$.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first example, the initial array is $$$[1, 1, 2]$$$. If we perform the operation with $$$i = 3$$$, we swap $$$a_3$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, obtaining $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$. One can show that there are no other attainable arrays.In the second example, the four attainable arrays are $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 4, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 3, 4]$$$. One can show that there are no other attainable arrays.
